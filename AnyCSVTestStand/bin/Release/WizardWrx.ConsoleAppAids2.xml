            <summary>
            ConsoleAppStateManager is an WizardWrx.DLLServices2.StateManager
            adapter, which exposes the adapted object through its read only
            BaseStateManager property, and extends it with methods that provide
            services applicable exclusively to character mode (console mode)
            programs.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Internally, ConsoleAppStateManager uses some StateManager services that
            could reasonably be expected to be defined locally. In particular, the
            services for ascertaining the redirection state of the three standard
            console handles and the names of the files to which they are redirected
            seem logically out of place. They are in that library for two reasons.
            
            1) The ExceptionLogger class, which belongs where it is because it meets
            needs that are substantially identical, regardless of the Windows 
            subsystem in which it runs. While I could have made a wrapper that 
            inherits from the ExceptionLogger, that seemed pointless for the few
            lines of code that would have gone into the derived class, when this
            library has unrelated dependencies on DLLServices2.
            
            2) It confines the services that invoke unmanaged code, and must make 
            significant link demands, to one library.

            This constant specifies the default number of seconds to wait when
            NormalExitAction is Timed. Its current value of zero causes a wait
            of up to 30 seconds, which should be about right most of the time.

             When WaitForCarbonUnit returns, the DisplayEOJMessage method on the

            <remarks>
            This method differs sufficiently from overload 2 that it stands on
            its own. Theoretically, every other overload could call this one.

            <remarks>
            This method ensures that the countdown text is never hidden, without
            altering the behavior of the MessageInColor object through which it
            displays text on the console. Specifying the same color code for the
            foreground and background color permits a MessageInColor object to
            display hidden text; which this filter prevents by substituting the
            current console colors when the foreground and background colors are
            the same.

            This simple overload, which actually came into being second,

            The intent of this routine is to ensure that a report or important
            message is actually read by a human.
            
            Consequently, this routine is very picky about the responses it
            accepts; only the ENTER key is accepted. To prevent the prompt being
            scrolled off the screen, all input is eaten (not echoed).

            cursor is exactly where the Console.Write method that displays the
            prompt left it. Bo this means does this method avoid unexpected
            screen scrolling.

            If you want the default message, there is a new overload, which has
            no arguments, that does so, by calling this method, internally, with
            a null reference. Having one routine that does the work simplifies
            changing the behavior of both overloads, should the need arise.
            </param>
            <remarks>
            The intent of this routine is to ensure that a report or important

            human.

            Moreover, you can't jump the gun. Any characters that accumulate in
            the keyboard buffer before the prompt is displayed are swallowed
            whole, with no outward sign that they were eaten. Though I could
            display a message, doing so would, in most cases, be seen as noise
            I might be persuaded to add it to a future version, as an option.

            There are several reasons that you might want to do this. The method

            the same thing, which caused me to realize that there might be other
            uses, too.

            Instances of this class permit a line of a console window to be used
            repeatedly for successive lines of text, replacing the contents of the
            previous print statement, so that the lines above it don't scroll off
            the screen.  Once instantiated, instances of this class behave almost
            exactly like Console.WriteLine, and you can drop them into your code
            in its place, because its overloads have identical signatures.
            
            Please see the Remarks.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The magic of this class depends on keeping track of the starting and
            current cursor positions. When a new instance is constructed, the cursor
            position is stored into a pair of private integers, so that it can be
            used whenever one of its Write methods is about to send text to the
            console to determine how far right and/or down the last such operation
            moved the cursor.
            
            Although Console.SetCursorPosition can be used to do so, and is used
            internally, the point of this class is to relieve you of the burden of
            keeping track of the cursor.
            
            Let it manage the cursor, so you don't have to.

            line is filled, starting at the left edge of the window, which is
            column zero (signified by symbolic constant LEFT_EDGE).
            
            Please see the Remarks.
            </param>
            <param name="pintNCols">
            This argument specifies the number of spaces to write, which varies
            from one to the length of the _strFiller string, which happens also
            to be the width, in characters, of the console window.
            
            Please see the Remarks.
            </param>
            <remarks>
            The constructors establish the length of internal string variable
            _strFiller, which is filled with exactly enough spaces to fill the
            whole width of the console window. Each time the Reset method is
            called, it evaluates the Console.WindowWidth property, and createes
            a new filler string if its value has changed. This ensures that no
            excess characters that would cause a line wrap are written.
            
            Unlike the other console writers in this class, this method uses the
            regular Console.Error.Write, which doesn't mess with the console colors.
            This enables it to ensure that there is no trailing white space in
            the instance text and background colors.
